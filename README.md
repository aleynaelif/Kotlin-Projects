# Kotlin Projects
 The projects that I developed during the mobile app development course


 - StoringData

    Basic example to understand how sharedPreferences work. The app takes input from user. If user clicks the save button, given data is saved. Even if user has closed the application, when he/she opens it again, he/she can see the last recorded data. When user clicks the delete button, last saved data is deleted. 


- KotlinIntent

    This is a implemantation of intent in kotlin. Basicly app takes 2 inputs and prints them in another activity.

- AlertDialog

    Alert and Toast message practise

- Countdown

    Basic timer example. It's using CountDownTimer.

- StopWatch

    Basic stopwatch example. This app includes runnable and handler.

- CathcingGame

    It's a simple game. The user tries to score by clicking on the image. But there is a countdown so player should click on the picture before it disappears. Player also should be quick because picture appears randomly. If player clicks fast enough then he/she gets points.I used a grid layout which has 9 images of Bojack. And randomly 8 of this images disappears so user can't click on them. Only one of the images is visible. When the time is over, player can't click on anything. If user wants to play again, he/she can select the yes button in the window that pops open when the game ends. Yes button starts the game from the beginning. But if user selects the no option, the little message in the bottom says game is over. Same project as the https://github.com/aleynaelif/Java-Projects/tree/main/CathcingGame but this one is kotlin version.

- Favorite Sitcom Characters
    This application lists my favorite sitcom characters. Clicking on the characters shows the character's photo, the show's name, and his/her name. Project includes singleton, recycleView, view binding.

- SQLite
    Example for using SQLite. This code contains the usage of SELECT, WHERE, LIKE, UPDATE, DELETE keywords.

- FavAlbums
    Same project as the https://github.com/aleynaelif/Java-Projects/tree/main/FavAlbums bu this is the kotlin version.
